### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Vrushti Mody](https://vrushtimody.me). 

I am a CS graduate with a passion for Full stack Development, AI/ML, competitive coding and Open Source Development! âœ¨

I am a prominent contributor to the repository called "my life"; I built its foundation and choose the contents that can be merged into it. I am an adventure-seeker, [blogger](https://blog.vrushtimody.me) and love to turn information into action through open-source projects.

[Join me](mailto:vrushtimody6@gmail.com) in my journey to convert caffiene to code ðŸŒ±
