### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Vrushti Mody](https://vrushtimody.me). 

I am a CS graduate with a passion for Full stack Development, AI/ML, competitive coding and Open Source Development! âœ¨

The engine of technology is powered by my curiosity, fueled with my passion and ignited by the spark of my skills. I am an adventure-seeker, [blogger](https://blog.vrushtimody.me) and love to turn information into action through open-source projects.

 I love connecting and collaborating with new people and obtaining different perspectives to a problem  â€“ nothing really interesting is ever built alone!
